# teachingMyselfCplusplusagain
a year ago I took an advanced c++ class at college, and passed with a 100%. I haven't touched it since and I've forgotten the syntax..
so Im trying to teach myself it again. Here's a stupid little app I cooked up to warm me up. 
I want to post these little silly apps so that maybe one day I'll look back with fondness at how far I've come.
Or it will all rot here. We will see
